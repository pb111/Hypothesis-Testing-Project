# Hypothesis Testing Project

**Hypothesis testing** is a statistical tool to test an assumption regarding the population parameter. This project is dedicated towards `hypothesis testing`. In this project, I have discussed, `hypothesis testing`, `p-value`, `significance level`, `types of errors in hypothesis testing` and `z  test`. I have also demonstrated their practical applications.

## 1. Introduction to hypothesis testing

-	**Hypothesis** is basically an assumption that we make about the population parameter. 
-	**Hypothesis testing** is a statistical tool whereby we can test the above assumption regarding the population parameter.
-	This technique was first introduced by Ronald Fisher, Jerzy Neyman, Karl Pearson and his son Egon Pearson.
-	The methodology employed in statistical testing depends on the nature of dataset used and the reason for the analysis. 
-	So, hypothesis testing is used to infer the result of a hypothesis performed on sample data from a larger population.


### Steps to perform hypothesis testing

There are various steps in performing hypothesis testing. These are as follows:-

**1. Choose a sample statistic**

-	The first step in hypothesis testing is to choose a sample test statistic.
-	Hypothesis testing allow us to check the sample statistic against a population statistic or statistic of another sample.

**2. Define hypothesis (NULL and Alternate)**

-	The next step is to define hypothesis to be tested. 
-	Hypothesis is defined in two ways - **Null hypothesis** and **Alternate hypothesis**.

**3. Set the decision criteria**

-	The third step is to set the decision criteria to be used in hypothesis testing. 
-	To set the decision criteria, we state the pre-determined significance level for a test.

**4. Evaluate and interpret the result**

-	Every test produces the significance value for that particular test.
-	Based on the significance level, we make a decision to reject or not reject the null hypothesis (Ho).
-	If the significance value is less than the predetermined significance value, then we should reject the null hypothesis. 
-	If the significance value is greater than the predetermined significance value, then we should not reject the null hypothesis.

## 2. Null and alternate hypothesis

-	While carry out hypothesis testing, we define hypothesis.
-	A hypothesis is an assumption about the population parameter. 
-	We define two types of hypothesis – **Null hypothesis** and **Alternate hypothesis**.

### Null Hypothesis (Ho)

-	Null hypothesis is a statistical hypothesis which assumes that the difference in observations is due to a random factor. 
-	It is denoted by **Ho**. 
-	Suppose the null hypothesis is **HO : µ1 = µ2**. 
-	It says that there is no difference between the two population means.

### Alternate Hypothesis (H1)

-	Alternate hypothesis is the opposite of null hypothesis. 
-	It is denoted by H1. 
-	The alternate hypothesis assumes that difference in observations are the result of a real effect.

## 5. Confidence interval

-	Confidence intervals were introduced in statistics by Jerzy Neyman in a paper published in 1937.
-	A confidence interval is a range of values within which our true value may lie. 
-	It is a type of interval estimate, computed from the observed statistics of the distribution. 
-	This interval estimate gives us a range of values in which the population statistic may lie.
-	So, confidence intervals consist of a range of potential values of the unknown population parameter.
-	The confidence interval has an associated confidence level that quantifies the level of confidence that the parameter lies in the interval.
-	The confidence level is designated prior to examining the data. Most commonly the 95% confidence level is used. However, other confidence levels like 90% and 99% can also be used.
-	There are various factors which affect the width of the confidence interval. They include the size of the sample, the confidence level and the variability in the sample.
-	A larger sample will tend to produce a better estimate of the population parameter, when all other factors being equal.
-	A higher confidence level will tend to produce a higher confidence interval.
