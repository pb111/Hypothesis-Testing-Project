# Hypothesis Testing Project

**Hypothesis testing** is a statistical tool to test an assumption regarding the population parameter. This project is dedicated towards `hypothesis testing`. In this project, I have discussed, `hypothesis testing`, `p-value`, `significance level`, `types of errors in hypothesis testing` and `z  test`. I have also demonstrated their practical applications.

## 1. Introduction to hypothesis testing

-	**Hypothesis** is basically an assumption that we make about the population parameter. 
-	**Hypothesis testing** is a statistical tool whereby we can test the above assumption regarding the population parameter.
-	This technique was first introduced by Ronald Fisher, Jerzy Neyman, Karl Pearson and his son Egon Pearson.
-	The methodology employed in statistical testing depends on the nature of dataset used and the reason for the analysis. 
-	So, hypothesis testing is used to infer the result of a hypothesis performed on sample data from a larger population.


### Steps to perform hypothesis testing

There are various steps in performing hypothesis testing. These are as follows:-

**1. Choose a sample statistic**

-	The first step in hypothesis testing is to choose a sample test statistic.
-	Hypothesis testing allow us to check the sample statistic against a population statistic or statistic of another sample.

**2. Define hypothesis (NULL and Alternate)**

-	The next step is to define hypothesis to be tested. 
-	Hypothesis is defined in two ways - **Null hypothesis** and **Alternate hypothesis**.

**3. Set the decision criteria**

-	The third step is to set the decision criteria to be used in hypothesis testing. 
-	To set the decision criteria, we state the pre-determined significance level for a test.

**4. Evaluate and interpret the result**

-	Every test produces the significance value for that particular test.
-	Based on the significance level, we make a decision to reject or not reject the null hypothesis (Ho).
-	If the significance value is less than the predetermined significance value, then we should reject the null hypothesis. 
-	If the significance value is greater than the predetermined significance value, then we should not reject the null hypothesis.
