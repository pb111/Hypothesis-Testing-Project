# Hypothesis Testing Project

**Hypothesis testing** is a statistical tool to test an assumption regarding the population parameter. This project is dedicated towards `hypothesis testing`. In this project, I have discussed, `hypothesis testing`, `p-value`, `significance level`, `types of errors in hypothesis testing` and `z  test`. I have also demonstrated their practical applications.
